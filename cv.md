## Code example:

Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place.

We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

```
function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++) {
    if (arrayOfSheep[i] === true) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```
